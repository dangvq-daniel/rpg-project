Hello, this is my solo makecode arcade project initally made for Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles in Fall 2020.

This is an rpg game that has different levels with different difficulties that are to be explored. The overall objective is to eliminate all mobs and reach the clam to move to the next room or finish the game. Your highscore is tracked based on the coins collected that are dropped based on how many mobs you killed. There is two types of mob: the ghosts (follows the player), and the bats (drops snakes on the player). Every time the player finish the room, there are power ups such as adding two additional fireball when firing or reduce the cooldown time and benefits such as add another life. Getting a power up will attract fire spirits to create an aura around the player. On the easiest difficulty, there is five lives, getting touched by any mobs reduce a life, getting touched by a snake reduce a life. Different difficulties have different cd time, mob speed, and life. The playerâ€™s character is made as realistic as possible by making it facing that direction when moving in that direction. There is a maximum of 7 levels and 4 difficulties. 

That is the general description of my project, feel free to explore it more.
